In narration and description, the paragraph sometimes begins with a concise, comprehensive statement serving to hold
together the details that follow. 

    The breeze served us admirably. 
    The campaign opened with a series of reverses. 
    The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of entries. 

But when this device, or any device, is too often used, it becomes a mannerism. More commonly, the opening sentence
Simply indicates by its subject the direction the paragraph is to take. 

    At length I thought I might return toward the stockade. 
    He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore. 
    Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof. 

In animated narrative, the paragraphs are likely to be short and without any semblance of a topic sentence, the writer
rushing headlong, event following event in rapid succession. The break between such paragraphs merely serves the purpose
of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail of the action. 

In general, remember that paragraphing calls for a good eye as well as a logical mind. Enormous blocks of print look
formidable to readers, who are often reluctant to tackle them.  Therefore, breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it
is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a visual help. But remember, too, that
firing off many short paragraphs in quick succession can be distracting.  Paragraph breaks used only for show read like
the writing of commerce or of display advertising. Moderation and a sense of order should be the main considerations in
paragraphing.

Use the active voice.

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:

    I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.

This is much better than

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting “by me,”

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,

it becomes indefinite: is it the writer or some undisclosed person or the world at large that will always remember this visit?

This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.

    The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.
    Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.

The first would be the preferred form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the Restoration, the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to be used.

The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard.

19:

    There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.
    Dead leaves covered the ground.

    At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard.
    The cock’s crow came with dawn.

    The reason he left college was that his health became impaired.
    Failing health compelled him to leave college.

    It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had.
    She soon repented her words.

Note, in the examples above, that when a sentence is made stronger, it usually becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor.

15. Put statements in positive form.

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.

    He was not very often on time.
    He usually came late.

    She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one’s time.
    She thought the study of Latin a waste of time.

    The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare’s works.
    The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.

The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer’s intention.

20: 

All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word not. Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express even a negative in positive form.

    not honest
    dishonest

    not important
    trifling

    did not remember
    forgot

    did not pay any attention to
    ignored

    did not have much confidence in
    distrusted

Placing negative and positive in opposition makes for a stronger structure.

    Not charity, but simple justice.
    Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
    Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.

Negative words other than not are usually strong.

    Her loveliness I never knew / Until she smiled on me.

Statements qualified with unnecessary auxiliaries or conditionals sound irresolute.

    If you would let us know the time of your arrival, we would be happy to arrange your transportation from the airport.
    If you will let us know the time of your arrival, we shall be happy to arrange your transportation from the airport.

    Applicants can make a good impression by being neat and punctual.
    Applicants will make a good impression if they are neat and punctual.

    Plath may be ranked among those modern poets who died young.
    Plath was one of those modern poets who died young.

If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. Save the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations involving real uncertainty.
