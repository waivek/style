<h4 id="rule-12">Choose a suitable design and hold to it.</h4>

<p>
    A basic structural design underlies every kind of writing. Writers will in part follow this design, in part deviate
    from it, according to their skills, their needs, and the unexpected events that accompany the act of composition.
    Writing, to be effective, must follow closely the thoughts of the writer, but not necessarily in the order in which
    those thoughts occur. This calls for a scheme of procedure. In some cases, the best design is no design, as with a
    love letter, which is simply an outpouring, or with a casual essay, which is a ramble. But in most cases, planning
    must be a deliberate prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee or determine
    the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.
</p>

<p>
    A sonnet is built on a fourteen-line frame, each line containing five feet. Hence, sonneteers know exactly where
    they are headed, although they may not know how to get there. Most forms of composition are less clearly defined,
    more flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer will bring the flesh and the blood. The more clearly the
    writer perceives the shape, the better are the chances of success.
</p>

<h4 id="rule-13">Make the paragraph the unit of composition</h4>

<p>
    The paragraph is a convenient unit; it serves all forms of literary work. As long as it holds together, a paragraph
    may be of any length—a single, short sentence or a passage of great duration.
</p>

<p>
    If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to treat it briefly, there may be no
    need to divide it into topics. Thus, a brief description, a brief book review, a brief account of a single incident,
    a narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea—any one of these is best written in a
    single paragraph. After the paragraph has been written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.
</p>

<p>
    Ordinarily, however, a subject requires division into topics, each of which should be dealt with in a paragraph. The
    object of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader. The beginning of each
    paragraph is a signal that a new step in the development of the subject has been reached.
</p>

<p>
    As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. An exception may be made of sentences of
    transition, indicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or argument.
</p>

<p>
    In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is usually a paragraph by itself; that is a new paragraph
    begins with each change of speaker. The application of this rule when dialogue and narrative are combined is best
    learned from examples in well-edited works of fiction. Sometimes a writer, seeking to create an effect of rapid talk
    or for some other reason, will elect not to set off each speech in a separate paragraph and instead will run
    speeches together. The common practice, however, and the one that serves best in most instances, is to give each
    speech a paragraph of its own.
</p>

<p>
    As a rule, begin each paragraph either with a sentence, that suggests the topic or with a sentence that helps the
    transition. If a paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a
    part of the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase (<em>again,
    therefore, for the same reason</em>) in the first sentence. Sometimes, however, it is expedient to get into the
    topic slowly, by way of a sentence or two of introduction or transition.
