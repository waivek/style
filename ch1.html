                </ol>
            </div>


<h4 id="rule-1">Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding ’s</h4>
<p>
Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Charles’s friend</li>
        <li>Burns’s poems</li>
        <li>the witch’s malice</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names ending in -es and -is,
the possessive of <em>Jesus’</em>, and such forms as for <em>conscience’ sake,
for righteousness’ sake</em>. But such forms as <em>Moses’ Laws, Isis’
temple</em> are commonly replaced by</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the law of Moses</li>
        <li>the temple of Isis</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The pronominal possessives of <em>hers, its, theirs, yours,</em> and
<em>ours</em> have no apostrophe. Indefinite pronoun, however, use the
apostrophe to show possesssion.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one’s rights</li>
        <li>somebody else’s umbrella</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A common error is to write <em>it’s</em> for <em>its</em>, or vice versa. The
first is a contraction, meaning ‘it is’. The second is a possessive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It’s a wise dog that scratches its own fleas.</li>
    </ul>

<h4 id="rule-2">In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.</h4>
<p>
Thus write,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>red, white, and blue</li>
        <li>gold, silver, or copper</li>
        <li>He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents</li>
    </ul>
<p>
This comma is often referred to as the ‘serial’ comma.</p>
<p>
In the names of business firms the last comma is usually omitted. Follow the
usage of the individual firm.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Little, Brown and Company</li>
        <li>Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette</li>
    </ul>
<h4 id="rule-3">Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is
            to travel on foot.</li> 
    </ul>
<p>
This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a
single word, such as <em>however</em>, or a brief phrase is or is not
parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the
commas may be safely omitted. But whether the interruption is slight or
considerable, never omit one comma and leave the other. There is no defence for
such punctuation as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marjorie’s husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday</li>
        <li>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect
            health</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures. Punctuate as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>February to July, 1992</li>
        <li>April 6, 1986</li>
        <li>Wednesday, November 14, 1990</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Note that it is customary to omit the comma in</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 April 1988</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The last form is an excellent way to write a date; the figures are separated by
a word and are, for that reason, quickly grasped.</p>
<p>
A name or title in direct address is parenthetic</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.</li>
        <li>Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The abbreviations <em>etc., i.e.,</em> and <em>e.g.</em>, the abbreviations for
academic degrees, and titles that follow a name are parenthetic and should be
punctuated accordingly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Letters, packages, etc., should go here.</li>
        <li>Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided</li>
        <li>The Reverend Harry Lang, S.J.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
No comma, however, should separate a noun from a restrictive term of
identification</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Billy the Kid</li>
        <li>The novelist Jane Austen</li>
        <li>The poet Sappho</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Although <em>Junior</em>, with it’s abbreviation <em>Jr.,</em> has commonly been
regarded as parenthetic, logic suggests that it is, in fact, restrictive and
therefore not in need of a comma.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>James Wright Jr.</li> 
    </ul> 
<p>
Nonrestrictive relative clauses are parenthetic, as are similar clauses
introduced by conjunction indicating time or place. Commas are therefore needed.
A nonrestrictive clause is one that does not serve to identify or define the
antecedent noun.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and
            more interested.</li>
        <li>In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been
            acquired by France.</li>
        <li>Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote <em>The Rime of the Ancient
            Martner,</em> is a few miles from Bridgewater</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In these sentences, the clauses introduced by <em>which, when,</em> and
<em>where</em> are nonrestrictive; they do not limit or define, they merely add
something. In the first example, the clause introduced by <em>which</em> does
not serve to tell which of the several possible audiences is meant; the reader
presumably knows that already. The clauses add, parenthetically, a statement
supplementing that in the main clause. Each of the three sentences is a
combination of two statements that might have been made independently.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more
            interested.</li>
        <li>Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently
            been acquired by France.</li>
        <li>Coleridge wrote <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> at Nether
            Stowey. Nether Stowey is a few miles from Bridgewater</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Restrictive clauses, by contrast, are not parenthetic are not set off by commas.
Thus,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Here the clause introduced by <em>who</em> does serve to tell which people are
meant; the sentence, unlike the sentences above, cannot be split into two
independent statements. The same principle of comma use applies to particular
phrases and appositives.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>People sitting in the rear couldn’t hear.
            (<em>restrictive</em>)</li> 
        <li>Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward.
            (<em>non-restrictive</em>)</li> 
        <li>My cousin Bob is a talented harpist. (<em>restrictive</em>)</li> 
        <li>Our oldest cousin, Mary, sings. (<em>non-restrictive</em>)</li> 
    </ul> 
<p>
When the main clause of a sentence is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate
clause, use a comma to set off these elements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged
            their dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the
            possession of Sicily.</li>
    </ul>

<h4 id="rule-4">Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The early records of the city have disappeard, and the story of its
            first years can  no longer be reconstructed</li>
        <li>The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of
            escape.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by <em>as</em> (in
the usual sense of “because”), <em>for, or, nor,</em> or <em>while</em> (in the
sense of “and at the same time”) likewise require a comma before the
conjunction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act promptly,
            there is still one chance of escape.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a
comma is useful if the connective is <em>but</em>. When the connective is
<em>and</em>, the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two
statements is close or immediate.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>I have heard the arguments, but I am still unconvinced.</li> 
        <li>He has had several years’ experience and is thoroughly
            competent.</li> 
    </ul>

<h4 id="rule-5">Do not join independent clauses with a comma.</h4> 
<p>
If two or more clauses gramatically complete and not joined by a conjunction are
to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a
semicolon.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mary Shelley’s works are entertaining; they are full of engaging
            ideas.</li>
        <li>It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
It is of course, equally correct to write each of these two sentences, replacing
the semicolons with periods.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mary Shelley’s works are entertaining. They are full of engaging
            ideas.</li>
        <li>It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach the town before
            dark.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
If a conjunction is inserted, the proper mark is a comma. (<a href="#rule-4"
>Rule 4.</a>) </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Mary Shelley’s works are entertaining, for they are full of engaging
            ideas.</li> 
        <li>It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before
            dark.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>
A comparison of the three forms given above will show clearly the advantage of
the first. It is, at least in the examples given, better than the second form
because it suggests the close relationship between the two statements in a way
that the second does not, and better than the third becuase it is briefer and
therefore more forcible. Indeed, this simple method of indicating relationship
between statements is one of the most useful devices of composition. The
relationship, as above, is commonly one of cause and consequence.</p>
<p>
Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as
<em>accordingly, besides, then, therefore,</em> or <em>thus,</em> and not by a
conjunction, the semicolon is still required.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>I had never been in the place before; besides, it was dark as a
            tomb.</li> 
    </ul>
<p> 
An exception to the semicolon rule is worth noting here. A comma is preferable
when the clauses are very short and alike in form, or when the tone of the
sentence is easy and conversational.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Man proposes, God disposes.</li>
        <li>The gates swung apart, the bridges fell, the portcullis was drawn
            up.</li>
        <li>I hardly knew him, he was so changed.</li>
        <li>Here today, gone tomorrow.</li>
    </ul>

<h4 id="rule-6">Do not break sentences in two.</h4>
<p>
In other words, do not use periods for commas.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I met them on a Cunard liner many years ago. Coming home from
            Liverpool to New York.</li>
        <li>She was an interesting talker. A woman who had travelled all over
            the world and lived in half a dozen countries.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma and the
following word begun with a smaller letter.</p>
<p>
It is permissible to make an empahtic word or expression serve the purpose of a
sentence and to punctuate it accordingly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Again and again he called out. No reply.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is warranted, lest a
clipped sentence seem merely a blunder in syntax or in punctuation. Generally
speaking, the place for broken sentences is in dialogue, when a character
happens to speak in a clipped or fragmentary way.</p>
<p> 
Rule <a href="#rule-3">3</a>, <a href="#rule-4">4</a>, <a href="#rule-5">5</a>,
and <a href="#rule-6">6</a> cover the most important principles that govern
punctuation.  They should be so thoroughly mastered that their application
becomes second nature.</p> 

<h4 id="rule-7">Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative
    quotation.</h4>
<p>
A colon tells the reader that what follows is closely related to the preceding
clause. The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than
the semicolon, and more formality than the dash. It usually follows and
independent clause and should not separate a verb from its complement or a
preposition from its object. The examples in the lefthand column, below, are
wrong; they should be rewritten as the righthand column.</p>
<table><tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><ul><li>Your dedicated whittler requires: a knife, a piece of
                        wood, and a back porch.</li></ul></td>
            <td><ul><li>Your dedicated whittler requires three props: a knife, a

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><ul><li>Understanding is the penetrating quality of knowledge
                        that grows from: theory, practice, conviction,
                        assertion, error, and humiliation.</li></ul></td>
            <td><ul><li>Understanding is the penetrating quality of knowledge
                        that grows from theory, practice, conviction, assertion,

        </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets or amplifies
the first.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>But even so, there was a directness and dispatch about animal
            burial: there was no stopover in the undertaker’s foul parlor, no
            wreath or spray.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A colon may introduce a quotation that supports or contributes to the preceding
clause.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The squalor of the streets reminded her of a line from Oscar Wilde:
            “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the
            stars.”</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The colon also has certain functions of form: to follow the salutation of a
formal letter, to separate hour from minute in a notation of time, and to
separate the title of a work from its subtitle or a Bible chapter from a
verse.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dear Mr. Montague:</li>
        <li>departs at 10:48 P.M.</li>
        <li><em>Practical Calligraphy: An Introduction to Italic
                Script</em></li>
        <li>Nehemiah 11:7</li>
    </ul>
<h4 id="rule-8">Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositve or summary.</h4>
<p>
A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon,
and more relaxed than a parentheses.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>His final thought on getting out of bed—if he had any thought at
            all—was to get back in again.</li>
        <li>The rear axle began to make a noise—a grinding, chattering,
            teeth-gripping rasp.</li>
        <li>The increasing reluctance of the sun to rise, the extra nip in the
            breeze, the patter of shed leaves dropping—all the evidence of fall
            drifting into winter were clearer each day.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation seems inadequate.</p>

                    Edward she cared for—it was San Francisco.</li></ul></td>

A common blunder is the use of a singular form in a relative clause following
“one of…” or a similar expression when the relative is the subject.</p>

        <li>Although both clocks strike cheerfully, neither keeps good
            time.</li>

<p>
A plural verb is commonly used when <em>none</em> suggests more than one thing
or person.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>None of us are so fallible as those who are sure they’re
            right.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A compound subject formed of two or more nouns joined by <em>and</em> almost
always requires a plural verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
But certain compounds, often clichés, are so inseparable they are considered a
unit and so take a singular verb, as do compound subjects qualified by
<em>each</em> or <em>every.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The long and the short of it is …</li>
        <li>Bread and butter was all she served.</li>
        <li>Give and take is essential to a happy household.</li>
        <li>Every window, picture and mirror was smashed.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A singular subject remains even if other nouns are connected to it by <em>with,
as well as, in addition to, except, together with,</em> and <em>no less
than.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>His speech as well as his manner is objectionable.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A linking verb agrees with the number of it’s subject.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is wanted is a few more pairs of hands.</li>
        <li>The trouble with truth is its many varieties.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Some nouns that appear to be plurarl are usually construed as singular and given
a singular verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Politics is an art, not a science.</li>
        <li>The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
But</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The general’s quarters are across the river.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In these cases the writers must simply learn the idioms. The contents of a book
is singular. The contents of a jar may be singular or plural, depending on
what’s in the jar—jam or marbles.</p>

<h4 id="rule-10">Use the proper case of pronoun</h4>

<p>
Required Reading: <a href="http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/pronouns/types-of-pronouns.html"> Types of Pronouns</a></p>

<p>
The personal pronouns, as well as the pronoun <em>who</em>, change form as they
function as subject or object.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will Jane or he be hired, do you think?</li>
        <li>The culprit, it turned out, was he.</li>
        <li>Who knocks?</li>
        <li>Give this work to whoever looks idle.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In the last example, <em>whoever</em> is the subject of <em>looks idle</em>; the object of the preposition <em>to</em>
is the entire clause <em>whoever looks idle</em>. When <em>who</em> introduces a subordinate clause, its case depends on
its function in that clause.</p>

<p>
<em>Us</em> in the last example is in apposition to taxpayers, the object of the preposition <em>of</em>. The wording,
although gramatically defensible, is rarely apt. “A group of us protested as taxpeyers” is better, if not exactly
equivalent.</p>

<p>
The possessive case of pronouns is used to show ownership. It has two forms: the adjectival modifier, <em>your</em> hat,
and the noun form, a hat of <em>yours</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The dog has buried on of your gloves and one of mine in the flower bed.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Gerunds usually require the possessive case.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mother objected to our driving on the icy roads.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A present participle as a verbal, on the other hand, takes the objective case.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They heard him singing in the shower.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The difference between a verbal participle and a gerund is not always obvious, but note what is really said in each of
the following.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you mind me asking you a question?</li>
        <li>Do you mind my asking you a question?</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In the first question, the queried objection is to <em>me</em>, as opposed to the other members of the group, asking a
question. In the second example, the issue is whether a question may be asked at all.</p>

<h4 id="rule-11">A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The word <em>walking</em> refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman. To make it refer to the woman, the
writer must recast the sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking down the road.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, nouns in apposition, adjectives, and ajective phrases
come under the same rule if they begin the sentence.</p>
